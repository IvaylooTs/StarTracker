basic information



Used raspberry pi imager to install image on device

cannot find raspberry on network

reflash with custom domain active, youtube video said it can be possible to connect to it.
no success, raspberry doesn't connect to network and doesn't show anywhere

3d printer was fixed partially
no extrusion and sd card slot is broken, it doens't lock. the locking mechanism needs to be stopped by bending the metal or changing the sd card slot. Other solution is using one of the raspberry pi's as Octopi and control it remotely

(the files on the sd card are crying for help, last message from cadets last year)
