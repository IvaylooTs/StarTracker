Step by step algorithm working:
 1. raw images undergo photometric and geometric calibration
 2. image processing algorithms find candidate stars in the calibrated image
 3. image pixel coordinates for each star centroid is converted to a bearing direction
 4. star identification (ID) algorithms match candidate starbearings to a catalog of known star bearings, and
 5.  pairs of corresponding measured/catalog star bearings are used to compute attitude via a solution to Wahbaâ€™s problem. These five tasks are
