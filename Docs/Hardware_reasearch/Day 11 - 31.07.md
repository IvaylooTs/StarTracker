For this day I want to implement the offset, due to the fact that soon maybe we will have to integrate the digital twin in the system. Also I need to help with the documentation and summery of the data and separating the data into manageable chunks.

###### TODO:
- [ ] offset quaternion based on angle test
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Arduino Communication protocol and read data from PC  
- [ ] Detect bad sensor config and reload systems
