For this day I want to implement the offset, due to the fact that soon maybe we will have to integrate the digital twin in the system. Also I need to help with the documentation and summery of the data and separating the data into manageable chunks.

###### TODO:
- [x] offset quaternion based on angle test
- [x] Documentation
- [ ] Arduino Communication protocol and read data from PC  
- [ ] Detect bad sensor config and reload systems

Found this documents with information on mounting -> https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/handling_soldering_mounting_instructions/bst-bno055-hs000.pdf

Here is example of something good to consider when mounting the system.

new problem arises
When you spin the sensor very fast it detects a big threshold and glitches.
one way to fix it is by adding queue.
this solution proved to give too much problems with slowing the IMU data transfer for 0.5 seconds (the threshold value)
the next solution just checks for a difference in two parallel reads. Small waits can be seen in graph, but the visualization is still good.
This problem should be fixed with sampling average of chunks of data or faster data sampling.
