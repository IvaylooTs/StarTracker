tried chanign settings, tried chanign tube, cleaning extruder


## Hardware updates
- [x] IMU Calibration research
- [ ] IMU Calbiration implementation
- [ ] IMU library check


We have absolute and relative orientation. We need to use absolute, because it uses the magnetic poles. It subject to magnetic interference


~~Quaternion are drift free?~~

to note about IMU: 3.3.3.2 COMPASS
- 3.4 Axis remap
- 3.5.2 Accelerometer configuration (cannot use absolute position without accelerometer)
- 3.6.1 Unit Selection (quaternion setting)
- 3.6.4 Sensor calibration (data registers)
- 3.6.5 Output data registers
- 3.6.5.5 Orientation (Quaternion)
- 3.8.1 Power On Self Test (POST)
- 3.8.2 Build In Self Test (BIST)
- 3.10 Calibration
- 3.10.4 Reuse of Calibration Profile

### Setting Calibration profile
It is important that the correct offsets and corresponding sensor radius are used. Incorrect
offsets may result in unreliable orientation data even at calibration accuracy level 3. To set
the calibration profile the following steps need to be taken
1. Select the operation mode to CONFIG_MODE
2. Write the corresponding sensor offsets and radius data
3. Change operation mode to fusion mode

after page 50 you get only register data and referneces for programming


Good for documentation (page 19)
