	- [ ] movable windows for camera



Added visualization on the UI so the focus is on the 3D view. Made camera and CLI toggleable in the down left corner of the screen. Want to add so you can move the window, but that is not necessary right now Added console inputs so i can send custom commands to the raspberry, even ones that are not in the buttons.
Make the received data into one window and commands in the other. Made functions to write to them separately.


Now I need to add last quaternion calibration. I tried doing it saving it on the html, but decided to move it on the raspberry pi for simpler execution and send the data via command.
