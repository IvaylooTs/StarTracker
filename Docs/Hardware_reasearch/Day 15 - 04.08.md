Decided to transfer the system from breadboard to custom made test board with soldered connection for better conductivity and simpler assembly

Added the lost in space by Didi and UART communication (which is in thread) from Ivaylo

Added button to connect active lost in space. Integrated the function. This needs to be expanded with threads.

installed ```pip install pyserial``` to main virtual environment

Made checks for missing Camera and IMU modules. basic stuff, need expansion toot display errors


Added better CLI ->
- better text headers with specific ASCII symbols for better design 
- made types of messages
- Added time stamps to commands
- every part of the print is in separated function and in `Flare.py` for usage in the whole system.
I think that we can use `if __name__ == "__main__"` to test each code module on its own.

Made intro animation  for the graphical interface using `Anime.js`

No need to use external quartz crystal, because the IMU has integrated one.

### found to be problem
Arduino gets powered from Raspberry PI 3v3 from TX pins GPIO 14.
Possible solutions may be using resistor or diode.
Tried using resistor with value of 1k ohm, but it still gets powered. May need to replicate the issue on breadboard and see if it is still present.
