- [x] fix quaternion information on displayed threejs model
- [x] Make a simple interface for visualization
- [ ] Add button for calibration to (0,0,0)



Made copy of all the scripts of the raspberry pi in case of lose or corruption of the file system on sd card.
Reorganized all the files to 2 folders - Week1 & Week2

Due to not much time I couldn't implement everything for the day

Fixed the coordinates on the three js 3d representation of the satellite 
```javascript
scene.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2;
```
This rotate the whole axis on x and fixed the visualization issue
Moved the camera to position `(2,2,-5)`

Added labels for better visualizations of the axis
```python
function createLabel(text, position, color = "white") {
const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
const size = 256;
canvas.width = size;
canvas.height = size;
const context = canvas.getContext("2d");
context.fillStyle = color;
context.font = "bold 100px Arial";
context.textAlign = "center";
context.textBaseline = "middle";
context.fillText(text, size / 2, size / 2);
  
const texture = new THREE.CanvasTexture(canvas);
const material = new THREE.SpriteMaterial({ map: texture, transparent: true });
const sprite = new THREE.Sprite(material);
sprite.scale.set(0.5, 0.5, 0.5); // Adjust label size
sprite.position.copy(position);
return sprite;
} 

// Add labels a bit beyond the arrow tips
const offset = 0.3;
scene.add(createLabel("X", new THREE.Vector3(length + offset, 0, 0), "#ff0000"));
scene.add(createLabel("Y", new THREE.Vector3(0, length + offset, 0), "#00ff00"));
scene.add(createLabel("Z", new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, length + offset), "#0000ff"));
```


redesign the UI to display information in 4 squared 
- received information
- 3d visualization
- quaternion information
- live feed (not currently working, because of threading issues)

This needs to be implemented into movable windows with snap functions. Currently not planing to work on it, because of other important things (calibration)
