Some important things for data from IMU:
- normalization of quaternions - correct math (not entering the 4d dimention, a.k.a. scaling)
- SLERP - smooth transition between data (no sudden jumps)
- Noise Clamping - if the change is too small ignores it
- 

Possible problems for Noise Clamping - I think, if threshold is too big, small drift can accumulate over time. This needs verification. 


Concept to check for nomralization of quaternion:
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation as R

def normalize_quaternion(q):
    return q / np.linalg.norm(q)

def ensure_hemisphere(q1, q2):
    """Ensure q2 is in the same hemisphere as q1."""
    if np.dot(q1, q2) < 0:
        return -q2
    return q2

def slerp(q1, q2, t):
    """Spherical linear interpolation between q1 and q2."""
    r1 = R.from_quat(q1)
    r2 = R.from_quat(q2)
    return R.slerp(0, 1, [r1, r2])(t).as_quat()

# Example usage
q_prev = normalize_quaternion(np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]))  # previous quaternion
q_current = normalize_quaternion(np.array([0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]))  # current quaternion

q_current = ensure_hemisphere(q_prev, q_current)
q_smoothed = slerp(q_prev, q_current, t=0.5)  # interpolate halfway

print("Smoothed Quaternion:", q_smoothed)

```
