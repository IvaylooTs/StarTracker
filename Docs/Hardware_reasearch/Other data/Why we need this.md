Orientation of a space craft is very important. From pointing antenna and payload to managing thermals and power. The problem with orienting a craft is that we need information. Data is very important. We need a reliable and repeatable way to get it. One in first glance, very simple and elegant idea is **Star tracking**. Stars don't change so, orientation stays the same. We can track them basically anywhere on earth, and orient based on them. Using simple camera modules with just visible light spectrum, we can get enough information to track data about the direction the spacecraft is facing.
