I felt sick


Started working on the problem of the algorithm slowness. Tried optimizing the main DFS function. No luck.


Tried to fix the angular distance. Minimized the error to around 0.1~0.8 degrees

main problem -> focal length
Check Nuke.py at commit 07.08, after the math fix. It works very well. Need Didi to implemnet it
