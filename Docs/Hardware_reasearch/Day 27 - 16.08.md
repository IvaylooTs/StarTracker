- add button for ui to open image in full screen



We did testing and Ivo made the wrap of lost in space to run many tests on his machine. 
I thought there were problems with the quaternions, but just problem on my laptop visualization was broken, on Ivo's computer it worked without any problems, providing amazing images. Then he coded error determination based on Michael's instructions and we got amazing view of the statistics and tracked average time for 155 images.

Currently Ivo is running around 150 images with different star counts (from 10 to 30), to find the best values for the system. We tried multi-threading, but found problems with the resources being unevenly divided and this show problems with the timing process. Better approach will be, sum operations or single threaded operation for accurate run, then compare the results.

We designed few other tables for the documentation and expanded the hardware and software architecture.

We designed the test with crosses on the screen to align the camera more correctly and get better results. This provided faster calibration on top of the stand.
